## UI file organization

SwiftUI views follow a one-view-per-file default. A helper view stays in the container file only when it is small, used by exactly one container, and expected to remain a private implementation detail. See [Project Structure Guide](docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md) for details and examples.
